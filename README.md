# Overstimulation and Lifestyle Behaviors Analysis

## Purpose  
This project analyzes the relationships between overstimulation and lifestyle behaviors to provide actionable recommendations that promote healthier habits and enhance mental well-being, especially for individuals in high-digital environments.

## Key Findings  
- **Screen Time** is moderately positively correlated with overstimulation (r = 0.45), suggesting increased digital exposure raises sensory overload.  
- **Stress Level** shows a positive association with overstimulation (r = 0.28), indicating stress as a contributing factor.  
- **Sleep Hours** has a moderate negative correlation with overstimulation (r = â€“0.40), highlighting the importance of rest.  
- **Physical Activity** (exercise hours) is weakly negatively associated with anxiety and depression scores, underscoring mental health benefits.  
- No significant correlations found between overstimulation and age, caffeine intake, or multitasking habits.

## Recommendations  
1. **Limit Screen Exposure**: Set boundaries around screen use, particularly in the evening.  
2. **Promote Consistent Sleep Routines**: Encourage regular sleep schedules and good sleep hygiene.  
3. **Implement Stress Reduction Techniques**: Incorporate mindfulness and stress management strategies.  
4. **Encourage Physical Activity**: Support moderate daily exercise to improve mood and resilience.  
5. **Personalize Behavioral Strategies**: Focus on individual habits over demographics for tailored interventions.

## Conclusion  
Behavioral factors such as screen time, sleep, and stress levels play a key role in overstimulation. Targeted lifestyle changes can effectively reduce sensory overload and improve mental health. These insights can inform wellness programs in universities, workplaces, and public health initiatives aiming to combat digital overstimulation.
